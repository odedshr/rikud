# rikud
A music player designed for dancers and choeographers

## What this is all about?

This simple web-page is here to help dancer working on a piece of routine, listening to the same piece over and over. Normally this would mean hitting the play button a random time before the dance-routine begins, dance for a couple seconds and going back to the player to reset the music. So to avoid these annoyances, the rikud ('dance' in Hebrew) lets you set -

*   Start-time and stop-time
*   Pause time before the music begins
*   Speed
*   Loop

## How to set my own music?

In order to play your own music, simply copy-paste any **url** of mp3, either from the web or if you running the local version, you can take files from your own computer (they usually starts with [file:///](file:///)). If you [download](index.html "Download Player") the html, simply place a "music.mp3" in the same folder and it will take it by default". Whatever you choose, your choice will be saved for the next time you use this piece of code. **Don't be alarmed that the downloaded version has no graphics**.
